Features/Changes:

- Added command for showing plugin settings.
- Updated compatibility settings to allow .NET8 CS-Script execution.

*********************************************************************************
NOTE: Due to the ST3 plugin hosting limitations some Python modules need to be fully
re-initialized during upgrades. Thus it is recommended to restart Sublime Text
before you start using the CS-Script plugin.
